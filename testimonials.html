							<span>"Timanson Builders did a great job with my bathrooms. I received an accurate estimate before beginning the job, they ran a great operation, and even helped in the  design decision making. The house was kept clean during the remodeling and the quality of work was excellent."</span>

							<span>"Our kitchen remodel turned out better than our expectations. Timanson's cooperation in all phases from designing, planning, construction, and also, yes the inevitable changes, were always handled professionally. The Timanson crew treated our home with the utmost respect and were very considerate to our lifestyle. We look forward to our next project with Timanson Builders!"</span>

							<span>"We have now had Timanson Builders complete three large projects in our home. We started with a kitchen remodel, moved on to the master bath, and most recently remodeled our fireplace in the family room. All three projects have turned out beautifully, but more importantly, we have continued to be impressed with this company's work. They are honest, fair, patient, and dedicated to the client's needs, making each experience enjoyable. For us, there is no need to look for anyone but Timanson for our future remodeling needs."</span>

							<span>"Timanson Builders went above and beyond to make our house look great. When something did not look right, they talked to us about it and fixed it, no questions asked. They truly wanted to complete a project that they would be proud of and one we would love. They would come up with ideas that we would never have thought of to make things come together better. Timanson Builders installed some backsplash we had picked out, they thought it didn't look good. We agreed, they took out the old backsplash, and reinstalled the new backsplash, that looks great. This is the type of service Timanson provided. They did all of these things with no change to the contract. I do not think many companies would do that. I will use Timanson Builders in the future and I would recommend them to everyone."</span>

							<span>"Timanson Builders did an outstanding job remodeling our master bathroom. We had a jack and jill, master bath, and a hallway bathroom remodeled. The work exceeded our expectations. They were professional in every way, constantly checking to make sure our expectations were met. We are thrilled with their work... so much so we have already started planning our next project with Timanson Builders. We highly recommend them for any of your remodeling needs, and felt extremely comfortable having them in our home."</span>
